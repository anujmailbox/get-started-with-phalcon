## Instructor: [Manish Kumar][instructor url]


There are a wide range of PHP frameworks out there and they all claim to be special in one way or another. Phalcon is worth a closer look though. What makes Phalcon unique and exceptional is it's speed and the way it loads and runs. In fact, it is the fastest PHP framework ever built! The reason it is so fast is that it is implemented as an extension written in C language that will load into your RAM as a PHP module.

In this course, you'll learn how to get started coding with the Phalcon PHP framework. You'll get hands-on experience with most of Phalcon's core featuresâ€”think of it as breaking the ice between you and Phalcon. In this course you'll be creating a simple phone book application.
